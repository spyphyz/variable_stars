  abstract = {An overview of pulsating variable stars across the observational Hertzprung-Russel (HR) diagram is presented, together with a summary of their global properties. The HR diagram is presented with a third colour-coded dimension, visualizing the fraction of variable, the amplitude of variability or the period of variability. The distribution of variable stars in the other observational diagrams, such as the Period-Amplitude diagram, is also presented. Some of the progresses performed in the field of variable stars during the last decade are briefly summarized, and future projects that will improve our knowledge of variable stars are mentioned.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$}The universality of the Cepheid period-luminosity (\emph{PL{$<$}i/{$>$}) relations has been under discussion since metallicity effects were assumed to play a role in the value of the intercept and, more recently, of the slope of these relations.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$}The goal of the present study is to calibrate the Galactic \emph{PL{$<$}i/{$>$} relations in various photometric bands (from B to K) and to compare the results to the well-established \emph{PL{$<$}i/{$>$} relations in the LMC.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$}We use a set of 59 calibrating stars, the distances of which are measured using five different distance indicators: Hubble Space Telescope and revised Hipparcos parallaxes, infrared surface brightness and interferometric Baade-Wesselink parallaxes, and classical Zero-Age-Main-Sequence-fitting parallaxes for Cepheids belonging to open clusters or OB stars associations. A detailed discussion of absorption corrections and projection factor to be used is given.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$}We find no significant difference in the slopes of the \emph{PL{$<$}i/{$>$} relations between LMC and our Galaxy.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$}We conclude that the Cepheid \emph{PL{$<$}i/{$>$} relations have universal slopes in all photometric bands, not depending on the galaxy under study (at least for LMC and Milky Way). The possible zero-point variation with metal content is not discussed in the present work, but an upper limit of 18.50 for the LMC distance modulus can be deduced from our data.}}}}}}}}}}},
